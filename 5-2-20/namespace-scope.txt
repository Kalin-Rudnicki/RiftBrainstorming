Similar to java/scala, being within a directory.
I really dont like this... but I think the first thing in the file needs to be something like java/scala's "package ..."
Ideally I would like to leave this out, but I think it just just cause for unnecessary unexpected issues.

As a note, "::" is used for namespaces, while "." is used for nested classes:

```rift

class Ex1 {

    class Ex2

}

namespace Ex1 {

    class Ex3

}

// ...
Ex1.Ex2
Ex1::Ex3

```

Anytime you go into a directory, you are forced to go into the namespace of whatever that directory is.
As you can see, it is totally find to have a class and a namespace named the same thing, so you could easily do this as well:

```rift

// : src-root/rift/Ex1.rift

namespace rift

class Ex1 {

    class Ex2

}


// : src-root/rift/Ex1/Ex3.rift

namespace rift.Ex1

class Ex3

// from another namespace completely:

rift::Ex1
rift::Ex1.Ex2
rift::Ex1::Ex3

```

It is totally fine to do top-level definitions in a file, but EVERYTHING must be inside at least 1 directory. No ".rift" files in the src-root



classes/traits can have methods or functions.
namespaces can only have functions.
