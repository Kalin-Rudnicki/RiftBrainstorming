My idea for a programming language, which continues to evolve over time

## 5-2-20

I would read them in this order:
1) null.txt
2) exceptions.txt
3) effects.txt
4) state.txt
5) debugging.txt
6) dynamic-code.txt
7) functor-apply-monad.txt

The rest from there are somewhat non-essential readings to get the concept
