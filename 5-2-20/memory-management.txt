Personally, I am more of a fan of the idea of reference counting that GC,
plus it seems easier to implement.

The idea of stuff hanging around unecessarily longer than it needs to really bothers me,
and then you need to handle when you overflow, and that just way more complicated.
With reference counting, if you overflow, you know that was the only option.


The only thing Id like to note here is that you can clean something up as soon as you cant "reference" it anymore, except in 1 condition.
If you are in a dynamic scope, you have to wait till you leave the scope, because you could always eval it.

Wait... nvm, if you cant access it normally, how could you ever do it dynamically, silly me.
Ive leave my thought process in here anyway, instead of deleting it.
