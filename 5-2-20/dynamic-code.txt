It is very important for me to have evals in my programming language
If there is no dynamic code in a function/method, there is no need to keep track of anything a dynamic eval might need to work,
but as soon as something like that happens, you keep track of the dynamic stuff, that simple.

```rift

    i: Int = 5
    res: Any? = i..toStr // => "5"
    resStr: String? = i..toStr.asInstanceOf[String] // => "5"
    resInt: Int? = i..toStr.asInstanceOf[Int] // Error: "5" is not an Int
    // TBD: Should all "." need to be ".." once you are in a dynamic call chain?
    // Are there any special cases?
    // Is it almost a warning if you do, because youve already made it clear you are fully dynamic at that point

```
Notice how cleanly the whole "?" paradigm fits in here?

I forgot to mention it, but the ".." above is syntatic sugar for making a dyanmic method call
Essentially something along the lines of: i.eval("toStr")

Now, there is something to acknowledge: Effects
You dont know if an effect could happen, so what do we do here?
The solution is to have effectfulEval and effectlessEval
I think just "eval" by default would be an alias to effectlessEval

```rift

    res1: Any!? = effectfulEval("callSomeEffectfulFunction") // => Unit!?
    res2: Any? = effectfulEval("callSomeEffectfulFunction") // => Compile error, effectfulEval returns type "Any!?"
    res3: Any? = effectlessEval("callSomeEffectfulFunction") // => Error: Attempted to run effectful function in effectlessEval

```

Note: A really nice thing about the "!" being forced to propegate up is that we would know as soon as we were going into something effectful,
not once we are 15 levels deep in the stack trace

".." would be syntatic sugar for effectlessEval,
and "..." would be syntatic sugar for effectfulEval
