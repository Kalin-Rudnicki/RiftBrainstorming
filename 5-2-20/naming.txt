Maybe this is a useless point, but I think a new name might be in order...
Originally, I came up with the name as a sense of "bridging the rift of what I like from Java/Ruby/C"

Now, I think the paradigm feels like Im bringing more of my own ideas to the table.
I am definitely borrowing a lot of ideas, probably most heavily from scala,
as it is the best (in my opinion, so far)
