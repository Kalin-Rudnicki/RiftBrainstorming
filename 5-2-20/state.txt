I think this constitutes something separate than effect, as I think a change in state is probably important to "acknowledge" (see what I did there),
but not necessarily the same as an "effect"

I would consider an effect to be more of dealing with the outside world,
and a state change being just that, updating somethings state.
Those things could both happen at once, or both separately, and should not be coupled.

I would say "$" would be a good symbol for state.
The same rules would apply to "$" as "!", and I think it would be fair to say that "acknowledge" would be similar enough in this case that it could apply to both.

A (forward) reference (if youre reading this in order) to dynamic code,
I think the same rules would apply here as well with "$" as "!".
You would almost need 4 different evals, (can state, cant state) x (can effect, cant effect)

eval => (can state, cant effect)
pureEval => (cant state, cant effect)

what would ".." be?
what would "..." be?
